# OCS Recruitment System

A full-stack web application for managing recruitment processes with access control for students, recruiters, and administrators.


BACKEND API- (https://ocs-backend-3gnr78h4o-aadi-bansals-projects.vercel.app)
FRONTEND API - (https://ocs-frontend-ra70e1hp3-aadi-bansals-projects.vercel.app)

Created an entire server-client based REST API that could be used for acessing data that is linked to different roles.
The files used for the creation of the API are in the repository

I tried my best in building the site and got a working demo on localhost but I could not properly host the site on vercel which is causing :ogin failed error to occur in the frontend right now
Would try to fix it but I am short on time currently due to various other competitions going on right now.

The working demo in local host for which I have also uploaded a video clearly shows that my API manages the core constraints:-
1) The code for the front end should NOT contain any sensitive information that
could be accessed using the Developer console.
2) All data exchange with the SQL table must occur on the server (Through the API
endpoint).
3) The password_hash field in the table is the md5 hash of the raw_password.
4) The Browser Client must not transfer raw_password to the serve
